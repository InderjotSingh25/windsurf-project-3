## What it Does

This project loads data and displays it as an interactive graph.
* **Nodes:** Represent individuals or accounts.
* **Links:** Represent the spread of information between nodes.

This visualization helps to understand how information (in this case, "fake news") propagates through a network.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML:** The core structure of the webpage.
* **[D3.js](https://d3js.org/):** A powerful JavaScript library for creating dynamic, data-driven visualizations.
* **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/):** A utility-first CSS framework for styling the webpage.
